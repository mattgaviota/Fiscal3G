.SH "DESCRIPTION"

.PP
 \fBwxglade\fR wxGlade is a GUI designer written in Python with the popular GUI toolkit wxPython, that helps you create wxWidgets/wxPython user interfaces\&. At the moment it can generate Python, C++ and XRC (wxWidgets' XML resources) code\&.

.SH "OPTIONS"

.PP
These programs follow the usual GNU command line syntax, with long options starting with two dashes (`\-')\&. A summary of options is included below\&. For a complete description, see the Info files\&.

.TP
\fB\-g\fR or \fB\-\-generate\-cod\fR \fILANG\fR
If you only want to generate the code without starting the GUI, use the \-g or \-\-generate\-code option with the language as argument

Possible values for LANG are "python", "XRC", "perl" or "C++"\&.

.TP
\fB\-o\fR or \fB\-\-output\fR \fIDESTINATION\fR
You can specify the destination of the generated code with \-o or \-\-output option\&.

The DESTINATION argument can be a file or a directory\&. It is a file when the FILENAME\&.wxg generates single\-file source code\&. It is a directory when the FILENAME\&.wxg generates multiple\-file source code\&.
